## License
I don't want to add any License, just use and update it. It was my end of term project
I used some OOB standarts (like polymorphism, abstraction, inheritage, @classmethod and like this stuffs...)
Maybe it will inspire you and give you ideas when you review other people's code and some class and function structures may be useful for you.
